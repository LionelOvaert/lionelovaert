## Hi! I'm Lionel ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working as a Data Scientist where I'm building Machine Learning and Deep Learning systems. âœ¨

I live in Brussels, Belgium. ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡ª

During my free time, I love to learn about cybersecurity. I'm very active on Hack The Box, having achieved top 1 in Belgium and grinding those worldwide rankings. I'm currently aiming to pass the HTB Certified Penetration Tester Specialist (CPTS) certification. ðŸ’»

From time to time, I'll also jump in some CTF competitons for fun!
